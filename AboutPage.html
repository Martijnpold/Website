      <h1 class="inset-main-text">About Me</h1>
      <p class="inset-sub-text wrapword" style="font-size: 20px;">My name is Martijn Polderman, I am currently 17 years old. </br></br>

        I have been developing since I was 10 and got very interested in making my
         own games using Game Maker, this was after playing games for years on my Playstation 2 and crappy computer. This means I currently have about 7 years of experience but most of my early work wasn't something
         you can really call "amazing", this included some recreated games like Mario with a basic upgrade system and 2D Minecraft with random world generation.</br></br>

         Developing started off as a hobby but ended
         up becoming my job after I branched off towards Lua and finally Java. At first it was never my intention of becoming a freelance developer but after being hired by a random guy on the spigot forums I decided
         to become a developer as a small job. Currently I work as a freelance developer for many minecraft networks and program anything from minigames to economy API's and gamemodes.</br></br>

         I'm still working on
         other side-projects like games or free plugins, those can be viewed in the "Projects" tab above. For more info on my programming experience head to the "Experience" tab.</br></br>
